An executable model could be an interpreter running the model. I typically do this with Python and more recently ES6(JavaScript). Once the model and its interpretation proceeds satisfactorily, then we switch from interpreter to a generator. The resulting artefact must compile cleanly and be runnable within the required framework without any editing of the generated sources.  This step often appears to be difficult, but it can be greatly simplified by handcrafting 2 or 3 examples and then generalising from those.

One of the founders of JetBrains (I forget who) suggested that any reasonable class hierarchy is in effect the DSL  for the application. Taking a step back the classes provide the executable semantics for the DSL.","I couldn't watch the videos and thus I can't comment directly. BUT ... for ""real executable models"" they should have been interactive / animated WebApps, not video."
